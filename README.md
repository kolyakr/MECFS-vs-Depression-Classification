# ME/CFS vs Depression Classification Dataset

This repository provides a **synthetic dataset** designed to explore the differential diagnosis between **Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)** and **Depression**.  
It is the first open dataset of its kind, created to help beginners and researchers practice machine learning on complex clinical cases.

---

## üéØ Objective

The goal is to predict whether a patient has:

- **ME/CFS**
- **Depression**
- **Both (comorbidity)**

based on behavioral, clinical, and symptomatic features.

## üìã Dataset Overview

- **Rows:** ~1,000
- **Format:** CSV (UTF-8)
- **Target variable:** `diagnosis`
- **Classes:** `ME/CFS`, `Depression`, `Both`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Characteristics

- Contains **1‚Äì5% missing values** across most features (to simulate real-world clinical data).
- Controlled **noise** in numeric features prevents perfect separation between classes.
- Diagnosis logic based on **clinical-like heuristics** (not random).

---

## üõ† Suggested Use Cases

- **Binary classification:** ME/CFS vs Depression
- **Multiclass classification:** ME/CFS, Depression, Both
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature engineering** practice
- **Missing data imputation techniques**
- **ML interpretability & explainable AI** in medical datasets
